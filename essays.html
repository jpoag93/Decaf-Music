Hello blank page.  How are you this glorious fall afternoon?  I‚Äôm fine, thank you.  I feel the urge to write, but I don‚Äôt know what to write about. Puppies, perhaps?
Patty and Ella are five months old now, and they are looking more like dogs and less like puppies every day.  They are eating adult dog food mixed in with their puppy chow. I am trying to housebreak them and not doing a very good job. Beagles, I have learned, are one of the hardest breeds to potty train.  (I read this on Facebook, which means it must be true.) 
True or not, it does corroborate with my experience so far.The girls never did get the hang of their pee pads.  When they were pups, they used to run to their pad, each grab a corner in their teeth, and prance proudly around the living room as if they were carrying a banner in front of a marching band.  
(They like to run around with things they‚Äôre not supposed to have.  Ella is especially fond of snatching Marie‚Äôs brassieres out of the dryer and fleeing with them.) Ella is quick and agile.  I am old and have a bad leg   Ella thinks it is all a game.
I could never get the girls to understand what that pad was all about.  I think they‚Äôre only beginning to understand what ‚Äúno‚Äù means.  Sometimes they infuriate me, and this amuses them to no end.  They have done some very disgusting things which I should probably not write about.  I
They‚Äôre doing pretty good on leash training.  Occasionally they do their business outside.  But most of the time they do it inside, which means that either Marie or I have to clean up after them.   We will all continue to work on that.  (We have learned that they do seem to respond well to treats.)
Any and all potty training suggestions are welcome.  
Gotta go.  Marie and I have 3:30 Jeopardy dateüòé

This stream of consciousness essay was begun two days ago.  It was originally part of another essay.  But it wanted to go its own way.
Sept. 26, 2023
It‚Äôs a sunny early autumn day at the Wabash River.  The water is low, and the current is slow  (Didn‚Äôt Ira Gershwin once say something like that?)  
I am seated on a picnic table with my laptop.I just finished changing the strings on my guitar for the first time in months, possibly a year. They were grungy and grubby..  The old Taylor sounds much brighter and warmer now.  I‚Äôve got a gig Saturday night, and I want to sound good.  
Changing strings is a rather involved process.  The closest thing I can compare it to is putting on a set of brand new tires.  The bridge pins are analogous to the lug nuts.  The strings are analogous to the tires.  And there is lots of loosening and tightening and a special tool to get the job done. But it is done and I am ready for Saturday night.  Bring it.
I only played a couple of songs and then put the instrument back in its case.  As much as I felt like playing, I refrained because I want to save my right shoulder.  I‚Äôve been faithfully going to physical therapy twice a week, and they work my shoulder over pretty good ‚Äì ultrasound, massage, weights, electronic stimuli, and a gadget that looks like a hairdryer but pounds like a jackhammer.  I had a session yesterday and have another tomorrow. 
What a drag it is getting old.
Note to self:  Start cobbling up a set list for Saturday and start advertising.  Or don‚Äôt.
As I sit here, it occurs to me that thousands of songs have been written about rivers  -- Way Down upon the Swanee River, Old Man River, Take Me to the River, Down by the Riverside, Down by the River, Deep River Blues, When the Levee Breaks, Time Is A River Flowing into Nowhere‚Ä¶..
Similarly, lots of songs have been written about the moon too ‚Äì Bad Moon Rising, Harvest Moon,  By the Light of the Silvery Moon,) Blue Moon,  Blue Moon of  Kentucky‚Ä¶.
Moon River is about both the moon and the river.
Speaking of blue moons‚Ä¶..
We‚Äôre entering such a lunar phase now.  Actually a Super Moon.   I hope it‚Äôs fat and full when Randy Pease and friends -- Tim Piazza, John Martin, and perhaps some special guest appearances (aka The Super Moon Players) -- play Saturday night 6-9 p.m. on the Red Geranium patio..  Spread the word. Tell your friends.
I have a confession:  I am no longer at the river.  And it is no longer Sept. 26.  It is the 28th, and I am at home at a desk, staring out a window, trying to imagine the river as it was two days ago.  Two five-month old beagle pups scurry around the living room, shredding newspaper and doing the things that puppies do.  Once in a while, when they start ripping stuff up, pooping on the floor, and running off with stuff they shouldn‚Äôt have, I squirt them with a jet of water from a spray bottle next to my coffee cup.   It seems to be working.  
Or perhaps not. One of the girls has broken into the cupboard and is prancing around the living room with a bag of Amish noodles.  I‚Äôd better deal with this. Hope to see some of you Saturday night.

I took a walk this afternoon.  It wasn‚Äôt a very long walk but it was a good walk.  I needed a walk both for my spiritual and physical well being. Walking was something I used to do every day until this summer, when it got too hot to walk.  And my knees started aching.  My walks are not as long or as frequent these days, and on most occasions, I use a cane.
But it is fall now. Good walking weather. Leaves are starting to show their stuff. And like the temperature, they are dropping, slowly, steadily, and almost imperceptibly.  I needed to go to the woods.  Bad knees be damned..
* *  * *  *  *  *
A light rain was falling when I pulled into the parking lot.  It was just kind of spritzing ‚Äì so insignificant that I didn‚Äôt even bother to turn on my wipers.  I parked and checked my weather app and I checked the sky ‚Äì the sun was shining brightly even while the rain was spitting down.  John Fogerty came to mind.  He once queried ‚ÄúI wanna know, have you ever seen the rain fallin‚Äô down on a sunny day?‚Äù  
It was the kind of afternoon where you might see a rainbow. 
I reasoned that, even using a cane, I could complete my half-mile circuit before any significant rain would fall, maybe half an hour.  (Interesting fact:  once in high school I ran a half-mile under two minutes.  Nothing like that was going to happen today.  That was fifty-three years and at least as many pounds ago.)
As I hobbled down the asphalt path toward the Wabash, it became abundantly clear that it really is autumn.   Lots of gold and a smidgen of orange and red mingled with the green of summer.  Dogwoods showed their bright red berries. 
 I emerged from the forest canopy onto the boat ramp.  The sun was still shining.  Raindrops splashed on the glassy surface of the river, and an occasional droplet splashed on me.
I paused for reflection and then hobbled on.
I walked alongside the Wabash -- the river to my left and nut-bearing hardwoods to my right .  
(Interesting fact: Somewhere on this path, right about here I think, I proposed to Marie nine years ago.  I think it was this time of year.)  
A great blue heron skimmed over the surface of the river. Across the river in Illinois the sky was dark and thunder rumbled.  There was the call of a bird I couldn‚Äôt identify.
Rewind to September 2014:
Me:  The nurse at the clinic this morning assumed you were my wife.
Marie:  Really?
Me:  Really.  I‚Äôve been thinking‚Ä¶. how would you feel about that?  You being my wife?
Long pause......
Marie:  I think I‚Äôd feel OK about that.
Me:  So do you want to do it?  Get married, I mean.
Marie:  Sure.  Why not?
Me:  Cool!
  *  *  *  *  *  *
As I shuffled through the picnic area, the rain picked up, but I managed to stay dry by keeping under the trees. Sensing that rain was imminent, I took a short cut through a swath that had been cut through the woods to make way for utility poles.  The leafy canopy overhead kept me dry, but the sound of raindrops had intensified.  I picked up the pace, inasmuch as a man walking with a cane can pick up the pace.  
When I reached the service road, the rain started to fall harder.  Raindrops pelted me as I made my way back to the parking lot.  If I could have, I would have broken into a run.   
The bottom line: I got wet.  Not soaked-to-the-skin wet but significantly wet.  And you know what? It felt good.
Epilogue:  (Four hours later)
A light rain splashes on the umbrella as I sit at the patio table with my laptop and a glass of tea.  Yellow leaves swirl about. Maynard, a black and white tomcat who took up residency here a few months ago, naps under a wicker chair.
Marie comes out to inform me that it is past six o‚Äôclock and she is hungry.  I have not even fired up the grill yet.  Dinner (sirloin steaks, roasted potatoes, and the last of the green beans) will be a little late tonight. Sometimes when I get in the writing zone, I lose track of time.  Not necessarily a bad thing. 
Oh well.  Time to power down the laptop and power up the grill. Look
